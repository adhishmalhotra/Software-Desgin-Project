## Step 1: Review Inputs   

| Category | Details |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Design purpose  | This is a Social Networking website. The purpose of this is to produce sufficiently detailed design to support the functionality of the website. The system should provide the user the ability to create an account, login into their account, search for different users in the database or different posts in the system, add/remove friends, share/delete posts, modify their profile, etc. |
| Primary Functional requirements |  Of the use cases presented in Figure 1.1.1, the primary ones are: - UC -1 because it is the first step in accessing the website - UC - 2 because it directly supports the core functionality  - UC - 6 because it directly supports the core functionality 
| Quality attribute scenarios | The scenarios which are explained above are prioritized in the following table: 
| Scenario ID |  Importance to Customer |  Difficulty of Implementation according to the architect | |--------------- | ------------- | -------------- |QA-1 |High| High | QA-2 | High | High | QA-3 | High | Low | QA-4 | Medium | Medium |  QA-5 | High | Low | QA-6 | Medium | High | QA-7 | High | Medium 
| Constraints |All constraints are included as drivers. 
| Architectural Concerns |
ID Concern CRN-1 Accomplish completion of the final system in the allotted time and resources. CRN-2 Evenly distribute the workload within the project across the development team to fully utilize the team's capabilities. CRN-3 Creating the first prototype model of the systemâ€™s structure. CRN-2 was selected as the driver.
