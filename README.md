## Brief Scope/Plan
The scope of this project is to develop a platform where engineers can communicate with each other, collaborate on projects in real time, and build a network. Contributors should be able to add/update files within a project and have the changes appear for any other users involved in the project. We aim to complete this project by leveraging the .NET CORE environment and eveloping a working data model which would highlight how different components of our application would interact with each other
